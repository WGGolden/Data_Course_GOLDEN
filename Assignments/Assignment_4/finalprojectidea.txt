I want to build a time-series model that learns weather patterns over various regions and predicts future weather conditions. I'd like to focus multiple areas in Utah like Utah County, Park City, and St. George. Data can be pulled from websites like https://rp5.ru/ or google. The reason for this project is that I want to learn how to build a predictive model and demonstrate this to future employers. To complicate the idea a bit more, I'd like to build an interactive map that lets users click on cities to view the predictive weather analysis of that area.
