	I want to build a predictive modeling system that analyzes the cryptocurrency Ethereum along with other stocks from NASDAQ that shows when a stock will increase/decrease in value based off predictors. I will include a predictor that is the number of mentions of the words "stock(s)", "stonk(s)", "cryptocurrency", "bitcoin" and "ethereum" over time. Another predictor is the unemployment rates and the poverty rates in the united states. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to build an impressive time-series model rather than try to predict the unpredictable. 

  I can go to a market analysis website (for example, coindesk.com/price/ethereum/) and see the current and past prices of Ethereum. I will use a data set of the price changes of Ethereum from this source: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/history?period1=1438819200&period2=1643673600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true to make the time-series model. I will also use Dow Jones Industrial Average as a predictor using data from tidyquant code. The data of twitter mentions can be pulled from twitter analytics (https://analytics.twitter.com) or other potential software (like https://www.tweetbinder.com). 
The stats on US poverty and unemployment rates can be found on the US Gov't Census (census.gov). All the data needs to have the same time periods (ex. Jan. 2020-Dec. 2020 stock prices v.s. Jan. 2020-De. 2020 unemployment rates).
